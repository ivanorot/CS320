Before compiling, I am guessing you will need to change the directory of the file that is trying to read (input.toy) 
in the mainprogram. Also, the directory of where it will write the output it will need to be change to a directory 
visible to your computer, that directory is defined in Lexemes.java. Other than that, it should run perfectly by
just running the program.
